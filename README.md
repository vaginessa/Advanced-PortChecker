```

### Linux

#### rpm

You can create an RPM, by running the `jpackage` Gradle task on a Linux host:
```shell
./gradlew jpackage
```
*Do note that you will need the `rpm-build` package in order to create an RPM.*

#### AppImage

You can create an [AppImage](https://appimage.github.io/) by executing the `AppImage` Gradle task on a Linux host:
